# Raw_data_for_Ts3R_research
This repository contains alignments data used for Teleost 3R research.
# Alignments
The alignments of individual orthogroups can be found in the file called "individual_phy.zip", the alignments are shown in the format "number_of_the_orthogroups.phy" (i.e., "1.phy" means the alignment of orthogroup 1), the alignments used for concatenating analysis can be found in the file called "concatenated_phy.zip", the alignment are showed in the format of "first+number.phy", (i.e., "first6.phy" means the alignment with first 6 orthogroups concatenated while "all.phy" means the concatenated alignment of all 30 orthogroups)
# Tree
The file called "Rayfin_tree_calibrated.tree" is the calibrated tree file used in this study.
